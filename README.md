Conkolla is a HTTP API Gateway (aka proxy) for interacting with the AppGate API. The name is a portmanteau for `Controller` and `kolla`, translated from a discovered rune stone in Gothenburg in Sweden meaning: "to look at the Controller".

# History
While we, the Customer Reliability Team, have been working with various integration projects which involved AppGate API, we learned that a tool would be handy to rapid prototyping. Eventually "the tool" became more feature rich and we started to believe it is useful for anyone working with AppGate SDP integrations. 

From an educational standpoint, Conkolla allows you to:

* Discover the API against a real system.
* Model or craft API requests and work with real responses.
* Let's you retrieve tokens when you have not yet covered the auth process in your script.
* Can be used as a API gateway connecting to many AppGate Controllers at the same time.
* Gives you discovery with a Web based UI.
* Gives you all the scripting flexibility to use the http rest API (JSON).
* Administrate your AppGate.
* and many more....

The AppGate API can be learned and discovered in different ways. One of the common ways is to use the developer tools in a web browser while browsing through the AppGate admin UI, or use existing API Gateway or API Mocker such as postman or prism. 
However, with Conkolla you get another option to choose from.

# Usage
Conkolla can be seen as a proxy, sitting between the user and the AppGate Controller:
![login form](/arch.png)

The user will basically do the following steps when using Conkolla:
1. Launch Conkolla.
2. Login to a AppGate Controller through Conkolla. 
3. Use the the new connection in Conkolla to run rest calls against the connected Controller.

# Quick start
## Get Conkolla
Conkolla (64bit) runs on macOS, Windows and linux. Download the binaries:
* [Conkolla latest release](https://github.com/Cyxtera/AppGate-Conkolla/releases/latest)

### Docker
```shell
docker pull mar8x/Conkolla:latest
docker run -p 4433:4433 mar8x/Conkolla:latest
```

### k8s
See the [example deployment.yaml](https://github.com/Cyxtera/appgate-conkolla/tree/master/k8s):
```shell
# deploy
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

# pfwd to app
kubectl --namespace ${NAMESPACE} port-forward \
$(kubectl get pod --namespace ${NAMESPACE} -l app=conkolla -o template \
--template "{{(index .items 0).metadata.name}}") 4433
```


## Run Conkolla
By default Conkolla serves on `https://localhost:4433`. Different serving options are available, check with `Conkolla --h` for more information.
Keep the window in the background, it will reveal a good part of the interactions between client - Conkolla - Controller, and can be useful to follow the requests & responses, and payloads.

### Windows
Open a cmd line or powershell, then type `Conkolla.exe`. 

### Linux & macOS
```shell
chmod +x Conkolla
./Conkolla
```
### Docker
```shell
docker run -p 4433:4433 mar8x/Conkolla:latest
```
*you will see a start message, something like this:*
```shell
./Conkolla

    ]
}
```

## Connect to a Controller
At this stage you will need to have a user with admin permission and privileges to read or write AppGate objects. For more information read:
* [SDP Help > rest api](https://sdphelp.cyxtera.com/adminguide/v4.2/rest-apis.html)

Make sure you know where Conkolla is serving:
* look for "url" in start message, or
* use the default `https://localhost:4433`

### Connect to a Controller through web-based UI
* Open a browser and point to the url (look for "url" in start message) 
* Default is [https://localhost:4433/login/](https://localhost:4433/login/)
* Allow the exception for the self signed cert when using TLS (recommended)

### Connect with an application, example curl

```shell
curl -s -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST \
     -kL https://localhost:4433/login --data \
     "{\"username\":\"admin\",\
       \"password\":\"secret sauce\",\
       \"ControllerURL\":\"cc1.packnot.com\",\
       \"apiVersion\":9,\
       \"skipVerifySSL\":\"true\",\
       \"label\":\"dev\"}"
```

Response example:
```json
 {
  "EntitlementTokenExpires": "2019-04-10T10:24:31.246Z",
  "authBody": {
    "machineId": "0e9076cd-e09e-4db7-6d24-480196700a42",

```

## Crafting REST calls via Conkolla
### Rest calls to an AppGate Controller
Rest calls towards an AppGate Controller are in the form of:
* `https://{URL}:{PORT}/admin/{RESOURCE or PATH}`

where as:
* `URL` is the Controllers URL
* `PORT`: the port of the admin access, default is `444`
* `RESOURCE or PATH`: the actual rest resource

Example: 
* `https://cc1.packnot.com:444/admin/stats/appliances`

### Rest calls via Conkolla
Note the separation of the different calls:
* From user to Conkolla: `proxy call`
* From Conkolla to Controller: `upstream call`

The first one is what the user will use to make calls, where the second is always initiated by Conkolla.

In Conkolla, a you always reference a connection; a connection which you previously logged into. Example, the same rest-call as above, you would specify it by referencing to connection `1` or `cc1.packnot.comdev`:
* `https://localhost:4433/get/1/stats/appliances`
* `https://localhost:4433/get/cc1.packnot.comdev/stats/appliances`

From the command line:
```shell
curl -k -X POST -H "Accept: application/json" https://localhost:4433/get/1/appliances
```

Use always method `POST` for the proxy call. The upstream HTTP method is included in the proxy call's path.

**Note: you need to drop the `/admin` part of the path.** Do not specify the `/admin` part in the path for the rest call. Conkolla adds it automatically on the upstream call.


Use also the [Conkolla > help page](https://localhost:444/help.html) for your Conkolla help.

# AppGate connection specifics
## Login options and controls
Either you browse the login form from the UI or get the possible options/fields from a rest call. Note there might be more options from the rest call than on the web login form:
```shell
curl -k -H "Accept: application/json" https://localhost:4433/login/
```
```json
{
  "accept_header_suffix": "+json",
  "api_version": 9,
  "content_type_header": "application/json",
  "loginFormFields": {
    "ControllerURL": "",
    "ControllerPort": 0,
    "username": "",
    "password": "",
    "otp": "",
    "providerName": "",
    "apiVersion": 0,
    "acceptHeaderSuffix": "",
    "contentTypeHeader": "",
    "label": "",
    "machineId": "",
    "hideToken": "",
    "skipVerifySSL": "",
    "dumpAGResponse": "",
    "autoTokenRenewal": ""
  },
  "pageinfo": "login page"
}
```
Note that the form data and the JSON data render to the same attributes and some boolean values might be therefore treated as a non-empty value instead as real booleans. Absence signifies `false`where presence of any value signifies `true`


| Param        | Value           | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----|
|label|String:text|Labels a connection with the given text. Allows you to connect many times to same AppGate Controller under different label. Labels allows you also to do bulk rest calls and help you sort and find connections. Any space in the will be replaced with `-`.|
|otp|String:number|if the user account uses MFA, enter the next MFA code here. Supports only built-in MFA.|
|acceptHeaderSuffix|`+json` or `+gpg`| Default +json, +gpg is used for downloading backup files. You can change it after login.|
|apiVersion|Integer:number|specifies what AppGate API version to indicate in the upstream headers, usually defaults ok.You can change it after login. |
|machineID|String:UUIDv4| A UUIDv4 string to identify Conkolla as a client ID towards AppGate Controller. None or faulty given, Conkolla generates a random one.|
|hideToken|String:`"yes"` or `""`| Disables any display/retrieval of the token for the AppGate connection for security reasons.|
|dumpAGResponse|String:`"yes"` or `""`| Conkolla will log the the request and response send to the upstream server. Good for debugging or curious people.|
|autoTokenRenewal|String:`"yes"` or `""`| Conkolla will renew the token if it will expire in less than 5 minutes from now. Also, you will be able to force renewal of tokens by the `/renewtoken`call (see below). Auto Renew does not work when using MFA.|



# Conkolla internals

## Proxy scheme (proxy call)
Proxy API to a connected Controller connection follows the scheme:
* `{HTTPS or HTTP}://{HOST}:{PORT}{UPSTREAM HTTP METHOD}/{CONNECTION}/{UPSTREAM RESTCALL} :: {BODY}`

`UPSTREAM HTTP METHOD` The method to be used in the upstream rest call:
* GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

`CONNECTION`: every connection has two references which can be used in Conkolla proxying calls, either 
* a numeric `ID` assigned by Conkolla at login time,  
* or the combined string of `{ControllerURL}{label}`.

`UPSTREAM RESTCALL`
* AppGate API path/resource, without the `/admin` in the path.

`BODY`
* JSON encoded payload if any

`Proxy Method`: Always use `POST` (this covers all upstream calls which are embedded in the proxy rest call).






## Conkolla API calls

### Global

| Path        | Method           | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----|
|`/settings`    | GET | Displays Conkolla and runtime information.  |
|`/login` | POST GET | Login form, login JSON params, do login on a Controller.|
|`/apispec` | GET | Displays the on-board apispec (might be outdated, use the linked from the menu for reference).|

### Connection  
These are related to the AppGate connection and might do rest calls to upstream AppGate Controllers.

| Path        | Method           | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----|
|`/agc/{connection}/conf`|GET POST| Display, change the connection settings for a Controller.|
|`/agc/{connection}/headers`|GET|Download a file containing the headers for upstream calls for this connection |
|`/agc/{connection}/renewtoken`|GET| Renews the user and entitlement token for this connection. Only supported if no MFA is used and connection is set to 'Auto renew tokens' at login time.|

Note: `/renewtoken` is currently controlled via a `GET` whereas it would be more reasonable with a `PUT`--  this might change in the future.

### Operations specific
Note these calls will always do rest calls to upstream AppGate Controllers.

| Path        | Method           | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----|
|`/stats/{connection}/{label}`|GET|Retrieves stats from connected Controller(s). Displaying single stats: `/stats/{connection}/`, where connection is a reference for the connection. Display stats of all connected Controllers: `/stats/0/`. Display the stats for a certain label: `/stats/0/{label}`.|
|`/revoke/{connection}/{label}`|GET|Revokes the tokens for the connection. Revoking single connection: `/revoke/{connection}/`, where connection is a reference for the connection. Revoke all connected Controllers: `/revoke/0/`. Revoke for all Controllers under a certain label: `/revoke/0/{label}`.|
|`/forget/{connection}/{label}`|GET|Revokes and removes the connection. Revoking & remove single connection: `/revoke/{connection}/`, where connection is a reference for the connection. Revoke & remove all connected Controllers: `/revoke/0/`. Revoke & remove for all Controllers under a certain label: `/revoke/0/{label}`.|

Note: the `/stats`, `/revoke` and `/forget` are not typical rest resources and will operate on one or many connections. For now we use method `GET` while this might change in the future.
